            <h1>Introduction to Globalization</h1>
            <p>According to Investopedia.com globlization is defined as:</p>
            <blockquote>
            The tendency of investment funds and businesses to move beyond domestic and national markets to other markets around the globe, thereby increasing the interconnectedness of different markets. Globalization has had the effect of markedly increasing not only international trade, but also cultural exchange.
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Globalization is and always has been inevitable. Since the dawn of man, the curiosity of the human race has led our ancestors to travel and explore their surroundings. Encountering new civilizations and culture along the way, we were forced to interact and barter with neighboring factions.</p>
            <p>Now most people associate the term capital with money but the difference is vast. Capital is actually any asset, including money, that can be used to generate wealth. Early ancestors used labor, crops, natural resources, and artifacts as viable forms of capital to aqcuire wealth. So its safe to say, humans have been "globalizing" since the beginning of time.
